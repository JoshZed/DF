## Bootstrap Project

I made this site at end of my UI/Basics module while attending DCI Digital Career Institute gGmbH. 
I was just fresh from learning HTML, CSS, SCSS and then quickly introduced to bootstrap. Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing 
responsive and mobile-first websites -W3Schools. I used it to make my final project for the module and I found it to be very intuitive 
and kind of fun to use. I would not recommend it for all projects but for quick static websites, it can save you heaps of time.
